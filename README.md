# Flatiron Phase 3 Project - Music Artist Database & Frontend
This is a simple repository that provides a React-based UI to interact with a local database containing music artists and their respective songs.

## Installation: 
1. Download the repository.
2. Open a terminal and run the following command:
    
    ```cd phase-3-sinatra-react-project/artistry-server && bundle install && bundle exec rake server```
3. Open a second terminal and run the following command:
    ```cd phase-3-sinatra-react-project/artistry-frontend && npm install && npm start```
4. Open ```localhost:3000``` if it doesn't open automatically.

The repository should contain its own pre-seeded database file.
